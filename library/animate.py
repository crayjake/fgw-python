TODO:
     - Display a single timestep
       -> 1D vs 2D (requires a converter)
     - Generate and save a whole time series
     - Add option to overlay multiple graphs, i.e a streamplot and a colourplot
       -> then you could get the stream + heat plot or just a colourplot of a different variable
     - Show or Hide the sponge layer
